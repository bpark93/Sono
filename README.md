## Description

Quickly find the information you need, when you need it: Discover the features required to declare an intrauterine pregnancy, learn about the sonographic features of a dislocated shoulder, learn where to stick the probe for the parasternal heart views. Sono has you covered for whatever POCUS content you may need.

The increasing evidence for bedside ultrasound and the continued evolution of smaller and more portable devices has ushered in a new era of fast, reliable and accurate assessment of patients at the bedside. Ultrasound has applications head to toe (literally) and will be relevant to you whether you are a medical student, resident, nurse or physician.
