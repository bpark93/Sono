        Being able to interpret any diagnostic imaging requires a firm grasp on
        the underlying physics of the modality, and this is especially true for
        ultrasound which heavily incorporates artefact-based studies in some of
        its mainstream uses.

        Like the name implies, ultrasound machines use sound waves to generate
        images, and is thus considered one of the safest imaging modalities

            deformations, generating sound waves in the process. These sound

            Structures that mostly transmit ultrasound and do not reflect are
            termed anechoic and appear black on the screen. Examples of anechoic
            structures include fluid such as blood, bile, urine.

            Structures that reflect less sound waves than surrounding structures
            are termed hypoechoic and will appear gray, and those that reflect
            more are termed hyperechoic and appears white.{" "}

            Another important mode is the <Bold>M-mode</Bold> or motion mode.
            The M-mode captures a single line within the image and all the
            motion that occurs along that line. Once you've chosen the line you
            want to observe, you can get an image of all the points along that
            line on the vertical axis as they vary in time on the horizonal
            axis. In other words, we see how all the points on that line are
            changing in time but we can see all the changes in time on one
            image.

            Its main advantage is its great temporal resolution which makes it
            good for depicting dynamic phenomenon or making time-sensitive
            measurements such as the difference in the thickness of the
            diaphragm during inspiration and expiration
