        Being able to interpret any diagnostic imaging requires a firm grasp on
        the underlying physics of the modality, and this is especially true for
        ultrasound which heavily incorporates artefact-based studies in some of
        its mainstream uses. Like the name implies, ultrasound machines use
        sound waves to generate images, which is akin to conventional
        radiography and ionizing radiation. This lesson will begin to illustrate
        just how sound waves become translated into the useful images you see on
        your screen.

          <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
            The converse piezoelectric effect is how ultrasound probes generate
            sound waves. When a rapidly alternating current is applied to a
            piezoelectric material inside a transducer, mechanical deformations,
            and thereby sound waves are generated. These sound waves travel out
            and away from the transducer and into the surroundings. </Text>
            <Text style={styles.paragraph}>When those
            sound waves encounter an interface between 2 different media, some
            of the ultrasonic energy <Underline>can reflect back</Underline> to
            its source (an echo). When this echo returns to the probe, it takes
            advantage of the direct piezoelectric effect â€” i.e. the echo creates
            mechanical strain on the piezoelectric material which then generates
            an electric current in response. The generated current is processed
            by the ultrasound machine to make up the grayscale images that you
            see on the screen. Pretty cool huh?

            Maximizing resolution while maintaining adequate depth is a key

            The power and intensity of ultrasound is also another important
            characteristic to consider. In practical terms, power will determine
            how much heat is generated in tissues. The heat generated from an
            ultrasound is generally insignificant as long as the proper settings
            are used. However, heat can be important to consider when dealing

          <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
            <Bold>Axial resolution</Bold> is the ability to separate two points

            <Bold>Lateral resolution</Bold> is the ability to separate two
            points on the x-axis or the left-to-right axis of the image. This is
            optimized in a region of the beam called the focal zone. After the
            beam is generated by the transducer it initially contracts to a
            maximum at the focal zone. This is generally at the middle of the
            ultrasound screen though some machines will allow you to manipulate
            this. This means that if you want to optimize the lateral resolution
            of a structure you should place that structure in the middle of the
            screen by adjusting the depth or if your machine allows you to,
            simply by adjusting the focal zone.{" "}

          <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
            The same phenomenon occurs along the thickness axis of the probe
            since the image generated is a 2d image, but the ultrasound beam is
            in 3d. The image you see on the screen is a 2d compression of a
            slice of what is truly going on in the patient. This results in beam
            thickness resolution or <Bold>elevational resolution</Bold> and it
            is also optimized in the focal zone.

            Finally, there is also <Bold>temporal resolution</Bold> which

            After leaving the ultrasound probe, the ultrasound waves can behave
            in many different ways. Sound waves can be reflected, refracted,
            scattered, transmitted and absorbed by tissues due to differences in
            the tissues' physical properties. How a tissue will interact with an
            ultrasound wave depends on 2 key characteristics: acoustic impedance
            and attenuation.

            Like audible sound, an ultrasound beam must be transmitted through a

            propagation of sound waves through tissues and is directly related
            to tissue density and the velocity of sound in that tissue.
            Differences in acoustic impedance determine reflectivity of sound
            waves at tissue interfaces.{" "}

            Air has a very low acoustic impedance relative to body tissues. As a
            result, sound waves will be reflected in all directions (also called
            scattering) and nearly no echos will be generated. This is a reason
            why ultrasound gel (a liquid medium) is required to seal the
            interface between the skin and the probe.{" "}

            Bone, calcifications and materials like metal have a very high

            appearance. However, because most waves are reflected, structures
            deep to bone or metal cannot be visualized (acoustic shadowing).

            is responsible for determining depth of ultrasound penetration - as

          <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
            Let's now discuss some of the basic modes of ultrasound.{" "}
          </Text>
          <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
            The majority of ultrasound imaging is done using the 2D or B-mode (B
            for brightness). This is the default mode that displays the image as
            varying shades of gray or black or white depending on the amplitude
            of echoes that are reflected back to the probe.{" "}
          </Text>
          <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
            Structures that mostly transmit ultrasound and do not reflect are
            termed anechoic and appear black on the screen. Examples of anechoic
            structures include fluid such as blood, bile, urine. Structures that
            reflect less sound waves than surrounding structures are termed
            hypoechoic and will appear gray, and those that reflect more are
            termed hyperechoic and appears white.{" "}
          </Text>
          <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
            Another important mode is the M-mode or motion mode. The M-mode
            captures a single line within the image and all the motion that
            occurs along that line. Once you've chosen the line you want to
            observe, you can get an image of all the points along that line on
            the vertical axis as they vary in time on the horizonal axis. In
            other words we see how all the points on that line are changing in
            time but we can see all the changes in time on one image. Its main
            advantage is its great temporal resolution which makes it good for
            depicting dynamic phenomenon or making time-sensitive measurements
            such as the difference in the thickness of the diaphragm during
            inspiration and expiration
          </Text>
          <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
            The last of the main ultrasound modes is Doppler imaging, and will
            be discussed in great detail in the screencast titled "Principles of
