        "Brian is a Medical Student at Western University with interests in ultrasound guided procedures and Emergency Medicine. After stumbling upon Dr. Myslik and the faculty at WesternSono, he was instantly hooked on the immense utility and broad applicability of ultrasound at the point of care. In an effort to share his newfound passion, Brian spent his lockdown downtime combining ultrasound with another passion of his (software development) to create the free and open resource that is currently in your hands. When he's not nerding out over ultrasound clips or pixel nudging Sono to perfection, Brian enjoys cooking, snowboarding and crafting new creative excuses for his underperforming Tottenham Hotspur FC.",
